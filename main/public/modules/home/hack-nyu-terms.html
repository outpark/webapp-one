9. 	Prizes and Awards

There are various prizes to be won with a total approximate retail value of $7,500 USD.  These prizes will be awarded to the top finalists, as chosen by the judges.

All prizes must be accepted as awarded with no substitutions.  Prizes may not be sold, transferred or converted into cash.  The winner(s) will solely be responsible for all travel, accommodation and other costs associated with obtaining or redeeming the prize(s).

HackNYU and/or its sponsors may make reasonable efforts to deliver prizes to the addresses and/or accounts provided by the hackers.  However, neither HackNYU nor its sponsors guarantee that any prizes returned to them due to a non-delivery at the provided address will be re-sent to the prize winner(s).


10.	Winners

Hackers who have been selected to receive a prize will be notified in person at the Hackathon and later, by email.  In order for a hacker to be declared a Hackathon winner and be eligible for a prize, he, she or they must have complied with and remain in compliance with the terms and conditions set out herein and deliver to HackNYU and/or the sponsor, a standard declaration and release form no later than twenty (20) days of receiving such.   This form will include a declaration of the participant’s compliance with these rules, an acceptance of the prize as awarded, a publicity release, a liability release, and any other documentation that HackNYU and/or the Sponsor may require.

HackNYU may request valid proof of identity and other relevant documentation and may disqualify a hacker at its sole discretion should it determine that the provided proof is not sufficient.

If the prize notification is returned as undeliverable or if a selected participant does not comply with all of the above requirements within the above time frames, or does not otherwise comply with these rules, we may disqualify the finalist, and the Hackathon judges will select a replacement finalist.
HackNYU expect to announce the names of the final winners on or around Sunday, February 21, 2015.
The chances of winning will depend upon the number of projects entered.

In that event, HackNYU may award prizes at random from among the eligible projects received up to the time of the impairment, or award no prizes.
HackNYU may also disqualify any individual who tampers with or in any way corrupts the registration or judging process, or who attempts to undermine the legitimate operation of the Hackathon by engaging in cheating, hacking, deception, or other unfair practices, or by attempting to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other attendees, including other hackers, mentors, judges and spectators.
